image analysis - find  object or labels

- classification or object detection 

usecases - 
- facial recongiztion
- missing persons
- medical image analysis
- -baggege canning
- product line analysis

image classicicaitn - supervise multi labeled
- cnn / res net - scratch or using transfer learning
- seed the model with artifacts from previou model - incremental training
- Record IO
- classify image of person as they


classes
samples
early stopping


object detection - supervised - deep neural netowrk
- image as 
- obkect with classes - and confidence 
- location and scalre - bounding
- trainig from scatch - or pre-trained - like ImageNet
- detect object in baggages at airport

classes
samples
pretrained model (only for object detection)



%%%text analysis - both super and non-super
- text or doc - 
--- categorize, sequence, or calssifieds
- used for prepreocssing for many NLP, sentime, named entity
usecase 
- sentiment analysis in social media stream
- categorize document by topic
- language translation
- speech to text
- summarizing longer doc
- conv user interfaces
- text generation
- word pronunciation app


blazing text -  word2vec - super set 
- pre-trained 0 can 
- easly scale for large text datasets
- train on billion words in minutes using large GPU / CPU
- market research using sentiment analysis 



Latent Dirchlet allocation (LDA) - unsupervised
- number of topic schared across texts or corpus
- each observation is a doc and feautres is a count of the word in the doc
- topics are discovered - 
- document is a mixture of topics - 
- usecase- find common topic within call center transcirpts  - find common patterns


*number of topics
*size of the vocabulary


Neural Topic Modle (NTM) - unsupervised
- classified or summarized documents based on topic detected
- retrive infromation from corpus based onn topic simaliries - or recommend content
- infers topics from observed word distrubiont 
- visualized contents of a large set of docs
- similar to LDA
- find topics of newsgroup message post 

*voc size
*numbe of topic

Object2Vec - general purpose neural embedding - words that are semantic similar
clustering of ojbects tha are semantically similar. 

translationing object (sentences, or other) - find relationship beyond paid
informatin retreval, products seach, item matching , custome profiling

paired tokens, pared sequen , and paired token to sequence
- usecase - recommend engine on collab filtering 

seq 2 seq - supervised 
input a seq of token - out a second seq of token
- speak to tex, radar, etc.
- RNN / CCN - encoder- decore arch 
recordio-protbuff fomrat- vocabular in JSON

*no required hyper params

example usecase - text as input - and audoio as ouput for pronunciantion
