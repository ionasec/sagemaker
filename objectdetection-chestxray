    "Object detection is the process of identifying and localizing objects in an image. A typical object detection solution takes an image as input and provides a bounding box on the image where an object of interest is found. It also identifies what type of object the box encapsulates. To create such a solution, we need to acquire and process a traning dataset, create and setup a training job for the alorithm so that it can learn about the dataset. Finally, we can then host the trained model in an endpoint, to which we can supply images.\n",
