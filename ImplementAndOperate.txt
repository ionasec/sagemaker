Performance
- automatical model tuning - auto model tuning with h param 
- hosting to scale model to need performance

Availability 
- use two or more endpoints to make models highly availble AZ

Scalabiliy
- scale instance through auto scale
- change #of instance and type of instance without outage
- scale to large number of transaction

Resiliency and Fault Tolerance
- spread instaces across AZ at AZ level
- 

Security 
- model arfitacts are encrypted in transit and at rest
- request to API are made through SSL
- IAM roles to access endpoint
- encrpted S3 buckets for model artifacts and data
- KMS key to endpointts to encrypt the attach ML storage volume

Appropiate ML Services
- Lex - chatbots
- Rek - DL for video and text
- Transcribe
- Translate
- Polly
- ?


Deploy / Operations
- HTTPS request - multiple varians pro endpoint
- Production varian for autoscaling
- Modify without down time


*Securiy of SageMaker Instances
-  Secure Jupyter notebook - ec2-based - run as dedicated ec2 isntances - not shared - map 
-  MAP SageMaker resources to VPC - apply Security Group
- Use ENI and attach to the SageMakret Service Account.  
- Control access - without internet access to the Notebooks
- use only VPC endpoints to access jupyer notebooks instace
- encry data at rest in in flight - end-to-end encrption
- lifeccyle configuraiotn - install agents on ec2 level - and OS hardening
- CloudTrail and and CloudWath for logging at API level and instance level

- same approach to trainig, tunining, hoste endpoint - without access to internt
only using ENI, security group, and VPC endpoints to S3, runtime, api, etc. 
- network level control  - only use
