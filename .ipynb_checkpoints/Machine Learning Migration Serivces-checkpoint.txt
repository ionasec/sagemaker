Migrate data from a source - streaming, media, IOT - to S3 AWS repository

1) Amazon Data Pipeline

Copy data using Pipeline activities. Schedular regular moving from on-prem or cloud. Pull data from various sources (e.g.DB,RDS, Redshift to S3) and in various sources

2) AWS Database Migration Service 

Moves data between DB - MySQL to MySQL or Aurora to DB

3) AWS Glue - ETL service - 

Extract from various sources, transform and load into destiation - 

Extract - Determnines data type and schema - using classifiers - crowles

Transform - Data engineering algoirthms in the transform piece - PCA or Feature Selection

Trigger - on demand, schedule or event drivven

4) Amazon Sage Maker

Load data from Github

Use Jupyter Notebooks

5) Amazon Athena

Run SQL quaries on S3 data

it needs a data catalog such as the one by glue (that creates the schema)

SQL transform in athena to get it ready for use


### Usecase - move dat to S3

A) Move data from EMR cluster to S3 -> Use Data Pipepline 
B) Move data from DB to S3 -> Use Glue with DB classifier 
C) Move data from Redshift to S3 -> Use Data Pipeline or Glue to Crawl and find Schema 
D) Move data from on prem DB -> DB migration service
