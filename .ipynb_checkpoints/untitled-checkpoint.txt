- SageMarker Toolkit - 

Studio : IDE for ML
Build : notebooks and market place
Traing and Tune:  Autopilot , Auto Model Tuning, Debugger, Experimensts
Deploy and Manage: Model Monitor -drift, Neo train one deploy, Augmented AI - human review
Label: GT to buikld and manage datasets


Studion - Visual Interface 
- build, train, deploy
- upload data, create notebooks, train, tune, adjust experiemnts, compare results, deploy models in production


AutoPilot  - Performance
- build traing and tune - inspect data, apply feature, engineer, train and tune multiple mode, rank moels, based onn perforamnce
- gives you the best model for your problem at hand
- use by dev without ml experience


Experiements - Evaluation
- organize model artifact, track mestric on models, and evalute training runs
- manage model iteration, using input parram, config, and results and save the as experiemnes

Debbugest - Fault Tolerance
- analyze, deintif, alterf for ML
- track real-time metric, consufions metric,s and learning gradient 
- generate warning and corrective action advice


Montior - Resliance
- concept drift detection
- detailed notification of the source for the drift
