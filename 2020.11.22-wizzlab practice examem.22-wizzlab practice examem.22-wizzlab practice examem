Data Engineering:
-Python library suites for data engineering / raw feature vector into SageMaker formats
-Real-time IoT data with Real-time analysis - Kinesis API PulRecords * is there a Kinesis Producere Library or Client Library? 
-Real-time video stream - find questionabl eactivity - use sagemaker to train - accurate and cost effective - KVS + Fargate + SageMaker
-Convert from Json to Hive data with Glue - most efficient data for Hive - ORC - Ojbect Row Column .. ?
-Get real-time data and perform ETL and put in SE - simplest, most cost effective, performant, and scalable, 
-Time series price prediction - KDM - API call - valid parameters for Put_record ... ***

Data Analysis:
-Glue to build data schema for K-mean - use cralwer * can glue to clasffication and data flattening?
-Decompose Timestamp into year, months, days
-Missing categorical data with max accuracy without bias - impute with deep learning
-Imbalanced dataset / Skewed data towads one class - SMOTE - synthetic min oversampling - 
-Streaming data cleaning, transform, organize into data lake for use in SM - simplest solution - KDS + Lambda for ETL. 
-Clean data with SCIKIT LEARN library transfomrer - 1) Labelbinarizer, 2)OrdinalEncoder, 3) OneHotEncoder, 4) SimpleImputer *Checkout the transformers
-Quantile binning transformation * check out again the defintion and alternative histrogram techniques
-Distribution visualization with histrograms 



Modeling / Algorithms:
-Binary classification Linear learner Algo - hyperparamter to build a binary classification model. prediction_type = binary_classifier
-Near Real-time anomly detection with - Kinesis Data Analytics Random cut Forest *Check this with temperature manipulaiton 
-Regression decision trees for house pricing prediction - overfit - user multiple trees and average... 
-Regressionfor multiplle productlines - predict sales / rates - and select the highest 
- Skewed data towards negative - True Positive performance - what metric to use - 
-input types in sagemaker - text / csv- label-size = 0 for unsuprivesd
-input types - target value no header - 
-xgboost algo for classification - hyperparamter tuning - objective set to mult:softprob *checkout hyperparamter of xgboost!
-binary classification - max concuarey hyperparamter tunning -  baysenian Search / Random Search.


Implementation / Operation:
- Facial detection for people recongition with Rekognition - * Learn about parameters and requirements...
- Social media sentiment classification with Comprehend * Learn about sentiment Analysis
- Data protection / confidentiality - large data lakes with multiple external sources and users on S3 - assess to roles and premssion- groups
- Recommend product based on demographic stored on S3 - Glue Crawler - Classifier - no Schema 
- Labeling of data with SM GT for auto and GT for human labelers.
- No data arriving thoruhg Kinesis Firehose when Data Transform on - lambda timeout ~ 5min in KFH
- Encryption in flight and at rest with KDF and S3 - Use server-side encrpytion with KMS. 
- KDF + Redshift - S3 in own account ot use BI and Quicksight. No data to Redshift -
