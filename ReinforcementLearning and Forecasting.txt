Reinforcement Learning

- ML technique learna a strategy (called policy), that optimizes an objective for an agent acting in an environmnet 

- Agent performs an action in Env
- Agent check the state
- Agent receive a reward

=> maximize long-term reward as a result of action
- trial and error strategy


Model makes indepedent decisions - based on markov decision processes  (MDP)
- works throgh a time steps
Env: RL operating space
State: describes the env and relevant past steps
Action: activity
Reward: reflect the state give the last action
Observation: data about the state at each step


Robotics 
Traffic light control - trial an error - based on weather / time of the day
Predict autoscaling - learn best autoscaling 
Tuning parames of web system -...
Optimizing chemical reaction
Personalized recommendation - learn best presonalization to make
Gaming - go champion - deep mind - highest level go playe
Deep learning - "see an environemnt" - and learn how to interact- deep racer

RL - build using TF or Apache MXNet
Rl - toolkit to manange interation with the env - IntelCoach and Ray RLib toolkits
RL - Environment - customer - or open source - Energy Plus and Ray RLib / buy commercial MathLAb and Simuling

hyper
- learning rate - too fast no converage
- discount - factor - short term or long term rewards (same a business)
- entropy - degree of uncertainty - exploit what's known vs explore what unknown



Forecasting Algorithms
- Deep AR algorithm for Forecasting
*supervised 1-dim timeseries using RNN (recurent neural networks)

trains a single model on time series - Deep AR trains on single mode across all datasets
stationariy vs non -stationary time series - deviation over time

*uses approx to predict how the algo will evolve

Deep AR algo on SageMaker
- Train and Test dataset
use a trained model to predict future of time series 

Time sersies based on the frequency - day or week, month, and year
What if scenarious ?
Builds on model and tries to find similarties acorss time series

usecase - global food demand, predict fast food quest, predict temperature, rainfall, stock prices / options, disease progession, supply chain mgmg

hyparam
- context lenght - what is the length for deciino
- epochs - max number of pasess over the training data
- pred length - forecast horizon
- time freq - granularity in the time series dataset
