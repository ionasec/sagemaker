Second part of partice test 1 - starting with question 34


Data Engineering
- Hadoop data lake to make prediction - Hive, Spark, Sqoop, Flume installed. Hadoop to SageMaker data loading ? *  DataPipeline? SageMaker Spark Lirary*
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/apache-spark.html

- Data Split for timeseries - sequential split ??
- Default SimpleImputer - scikit-learn - default value is MEAN
- preprocessing Container for trianing and inference with ski-learn sagemaker integration

- OnHotEncoder - 
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html - drop category in features

Analysis
- word frequency in a document.  * Term frequency Inverse document frequency / Orthognoal Spare Bigram ?
- find common words or phrases in feeds .. 
- Correct for banks and outliers - 
- outlier indetification quickly - scatter plots and box plots
- * LARS, LOF, OLSR ?
- OnHotEncoder transformer - drop method. 

Modeling
- future price prediction - timeseries - evalution strategy - cross validation method - time series corss validation
- real time anamaly detection - CSV - classification - linear learner - multiclass-classifier preditor
- robotic automation - simulaiton-based reinforcement learning
- classification of car makes using camera - multiclass
- classification of dog breed from insta - 
- voice recongiition  - sequence to sequence
- classification of state and OCR of the nubmer - out of domain samples - reduce outlier impact  - slow learning rate
- near real-time prediction of actions for forecasting ARIMA and ETS - you have many timeseries... DeepAR 
- k-means scorping parameters.. 

Implementation and Operation
- source dynamoDB csv format in s3 with auto updates. also ad hoc queries. * DataPipeline...
- log data for prediction - unstructured data on s3 - get into csv - to another s3 - 
- CSV as trainig for binary classification with XGBoost - 
- Custom ML model with HTTPS endpoint. Container questions -  Result to client - 8080 web server, invoke endpot headers, accept POST from invocation endpoint
- near real-time prediction - evalution production performance in jupyter noteboo - 
- train with large dataset and takes too long - imporve trainig performance -
